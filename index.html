                        Hi, my name is Noemi Corona. I am a second year <strong>Computer Science</strong> student, and I'm excited to see what the new year has in store. A fun fact about me is that I love going to Six Flags and my favorite ride is <em>CraZanity</em>. Something new I'm currently learning is bowling. Although I've bowled before, I'm taking a class to learn the technical and professional side of the sport.

                        I'm excited to learn the fundamentals of <strong>Git</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong> & <strong>CSS</strong>!
